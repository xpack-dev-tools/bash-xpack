## Install

The full details of installing theÂ **xPack GNU Bash**
on various platforms are presented in the [Install Guide](/docs/install/).

### Easy install

The easiest way to install GNU Bash is with
[`xpm`]({% raw %}{{site.baseurl}/xpm/)
by using the **binary xPack**, available as
[`@xpack-dev-tools/bash`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xpack-dev-tools/bash)
from the [`npmjs.com`](https://www.npmjs.com) registry.

With the `xpm` tool available, installing
the latest version of the package and adding it as
a development dependency for a project is quite easy:

```sh
cd my-project
xpm init # Add a package.json if not already present

xpm install @xpack-dev-tools/bash@latest --verbose

ls -l xpacks/.bin
```

To install this specific version, use:

```sh
xpm install @xpack-dev-tools/bash@{frontMatter.version}}.{{page.npm_subversion} --verbose
```

It is also possible to install Meson Build globally, in the user home folder,
but this requires xPack aware tools to automatically identify them and
manage paths.

```sh
xpm install --global @xpack-dev-tools/bash@latest --verbose
```

### Uninstall

To remove the links created by xpm in the current project:

```sh
cd my-project

xpm uninstall @xpack-dev-tools/bash
```

To completely remove the package from the central xPack store:

```sh
xpm uninstall --global @xpack-dev-tools/bash
```

## Compliance

The **xPack GNU Bash** is based on the official
[GNU Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/), with minimal changes.

The current version is based on:

- GNU Bash release
[{frontMatter.upstream_version}](https://github.com/Kitware/GNU Bash/releases/tag/v{frontMatter.upstream_version}/)
from {frontMatter.upstream_release_date}.

## Changes

Compared to the upstream version, the Windows version also supports
spawning scripts via `cmd.exe /c`. These scripts are used by **npm**/**xpm**
to redirect invocations to the central packages repository.

## Bug fixes

- none

## Enhancements

- none

## Known problems

- none

## Documentation

The current GNU Bash documentation is available online from:

- [https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/)

## Build

The binaries for all supported platforms
(Windows, macOS and GNU/Linux) were built using the
[xPack Build Box (XBB)](https://xpack.github.io/xbb/), a set
of build environments based on slightly older distributions, that should be
compatible with most recent systems.

For the prerequisites and more details on the build procedure, please see the
[Maintainer Info](/docs/maintainer/) page.

## CI tests

Before publishing, a set of simple tests were performed on an exhaustive
set of platforms. The results are available from:

- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/bash-xpack/actions/)
- [Travis CI](https://app.travis-ci.com/github/xpack-dev-tools/bash-xpack/builds/)
